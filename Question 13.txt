Question 13
1. Extending the add method for StringCalculator class to cover the new requirements above.
2. Write an entire Test class that focuses only on testing the new requirements (Extended Functionalities)


Steps:
1. Create a test class called StringCalculatorExtendedTests.
1. Write some unit tests in StringCalculatorExtendedTests to test that the add method will throw an exception when a negative number is given and another test to check that numbers greater than 1000 are ignored.  These tests should fail at this point in time.
2. Refactor the add method in StringCalculator to throw exception when the input is negative.
3. Run tests in StringCalculatorExtendedTests.  The tests that check that the add method throws with negative input should now succeed.  If it doesn’t go back to step 2
4. Refactor the add method to ignore input > 1000.
5. Run tests in StringCalculatorExtendedTests.  The test should all succeed now.  If they don’t go back to step 4.
